## Consider Windows...

Capital budgeting is the process of figuring out how we will save or invest or monies. There are different approaches that take place between a limited and unlimited strategy.

For example when Microsoft set off to create Windows 7; they knew that it had to be built, and it didn't really matter how much the research would cost. Vista was a complete failure and the companies primary cash cow was about going dry. They hired more people, sold long term assets to increase cash flow, and turned the crank until the product came out ready.

In contrast when they created DOS 1.0; their very first version, things were a lot different. The company only had about 100k, which needed to last them until the operating system was fully productized. During this time every item needed to be carefully decided, as one bad investment could bankrupt them.

## What are the general types of budgeting problems.

Budgeting challenges come from these three dimensions:

1. size-disparity problem.
2. unequal lives problem.
3. time-disparity problem.

Size; how big is the project now versus how big will it be by completion. Does our business have the scale to handle those volumes, or are we setting our selves up for failure. Consider an ice cream store that does well at 100 customers today, what happens at 10,000/day?

Unequal lives; having differ business duration terms that do not all align. A good example is ski lodges and resorts. They own the maintenance year around, but only do business 5 months out of the year.

time; you expected to get back X% but so far are only at (X-N)%. It would not be uncommon for a portion of those expected earnings to be assigned to the next project. Now the next version is underfunded as is the previous, causing pain on two fronts.

## What are mutually exclusive projects, what problems do they cause

Imagine that you have 10,000$ and want to become an uber driver. The first step might be to purchase a vehicle; the options are:

2012 Ford - 8000$
2014 Dodge - 9500$
2010 Chevy - 7200$
A mutually exclusive selection has become required as it is not possible to more than one. The same concept appears in other businesses when we need to select an investment.

This can introduce challenges with discounted cash-flow as we can not diversify, thus there is more risk of making a poor choice. To offset the risk we need to compare NPV and evaluate which one is the better deal.
