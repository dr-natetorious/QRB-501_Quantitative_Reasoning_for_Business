## What is trade discount

Trade discount and rate refers to the delta between a manufactures listing price, distributors price, and customer's price of an item. For example in a chair might cost 50$ in raw material. This is sold to a furniture store for 100$ who in turn sells it to a customer for 150$.

In this scenario everyone along the way is making 50$ for the sale; minus any overhead from labor, storage and related items. These are ignored in this trivial example but can quickly eat into the profit margin. 

It is important to understand these concepts as they allow us to calculate profit margins. If the profit margins are not high enough then the business model needs to compensate with higher volumes. Understanding these break even points can help guide the business into situations that are more likely to be successful over the long term.

## How does your organization decide an acceptable profit margin

My groups profit margins are insanely massive. This is due to our business model being an online service that provides device management.

Once purchased a customer's IT department can upload application content and define policies for their employees. For example if an employee is trying to access their email on a jail broke iPhone deny the access.

From our perspective this is effectively holding a collection of database records, retaining a bit of storage, and handing out few gigabytes here and there in networking.

On a per device cost basis this equates to pennies per month compared to the 7.99$/user per month retail licensee.

Though our sister team sells virtual desktop solutions, basically those same IT admins can opt to run sensitive or app compatibility challenged  workloads in the cloud. They charge 20$/month per user but pay 4-10 cents per hour per user of usage.

They have high margins assuming no one uses them (e.g. over provisioned); we have high margins period. 

## Time is Money

Time is money, and it therefore has monetary value. Consider the difference between your friend paying you back 100$ in 10 minutes versus in two months. The prior has more immediate opportunities.

Another concern is related to the risk of payment being received. If your friend will pay you back in 10 minutes there is not a large unknown in the accounts receivable budget; in regards to it being paid on time. You know quickly, you can plan accurately, you can therefore execute informed.

In contrast two months from now there could be a delay or the amount only partially payable. This makes changes the problem space from a planning to a forecasting issue. 

It therefore stands to reason that incentives, such as discounts, should exist to encourage prompt payment; while penalties need to be applied to later payments. The line between the discount and penalty is defined in the terms of the loan (EOM/ROG/ASAP/etc.); and is dictated by time.

## What scenarios involve a markup of selling prices

Businesses which manufacture goods or services will be more interested in looking at profits in terms of costs. Another example would be commodity centric organizations such as oil or copper mining.

This is because they can charge any markup that the market is willing to pay, however the amount to produce the item is fixed or needs to be controlled.

However for distributors they have less control over how much an item costs coming in, but they do have control over the amount charged. This makes inventory and profit margin controll easier.

One of the challenges for businesses in manufacturing, services, and commodities is that the price of their goods is not fixed. Consider Delta Airlines which has the needs to focus on their costs but still take into account oil prices changing year over year.

For these businesses there is a concept called a futures market, where investors can either hedge or speculate on a price of the raw goods. Hedging is typically focused on something they will need themselves, speculating deals with betting someone else will need the item.

Using the futures market Delta Airline could "lock in" the current 20$/barrel price of oil for the next year, and then make their accounting process much simpler. 

However they run the risk that once the price is locked in that it might fall to 10$/barrel, and now they are paying more than market value. Though for large prices it can be worth the stability and reduced risk to take these options any ways.
