## Dollar Today versus 2$ tomorrow

If a person has 1$ today, that represents known guaranteed and tangible opportunities. For example I could buy a movie ticket and see a movie if I chose too; the likelihood of affording this is well known.

However in the future that 1$ might not be worth 1$ as there are various risks that cannot be known ahead of time. For example interest rates could rise and introduce inflation. If inflation raises 3% then that same money only has 97 cents buying power. Another could be that dollar was poorly invested, and is worth half or 3/4ths. 

These trade offs mean that a smart investor needs to understand what they are getting in exchange for giving up that opportunity. Perhaps the person believes their investment will grow in value and the potential to have 2$ next year is more intincing than spending that 1$ today.

The general rule of thumb is take your age and subtract 70 from it. That is the percentage of savings that should be in bonds. As 10 years old that value is zero; compounded interest is more critical than the risk profile.

If she had instead given you 50$ worth of a good index fund such as S&P; that same gift would be worth 1850$ plus any dividends.

There is the risk that the gift would have expired worthless, but that is the benefit of index funds versus stocks. The stock is more likely to go out of business due to the decrease of diversification.

Compare that to something like XLK (US tech stocks); that would require Google, MSFT, Apple, etc. to all be out of business. Before that point the index would likely rebalance and select newer candidates (e.g. trade IBM for AMZN).
